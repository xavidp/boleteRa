Some R scripts to get some visualization out of mushroom locations

Data taken through Zamiadroid on an Android powered-smartphone:

Can be viewed geolocalized there from the smartphone itself:

But then you might want to keep it elsewhere available online through a web browserm aggregating info from the citations you recorded across years & smartphones (& different peoplem eventually), while also adding extra info to the database such as elevation over the sea level, nearest city/village name, nearest meteorological station (in case you wonder how much did it rain in that area beforehand that day in which I did find so little - or so many - mushrooms in that location ), etc. 

All these data management ad enrichment is done in this project through R.

See some example graphs produced out of it:

If you want, clone, fork and Enjoy!
